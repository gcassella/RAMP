# RAMP: Raytracing Achieved via Massive Parallelisation

*RAMP* is a Monte Carlo raytracing package for the simulation of neutron instrumentation, written in Python and parallelized via the OpenCL API.

## Documentation

The documentation for RAMP is [hosted online on readthedocs](https://ramp-mcr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and may also be found in the `doc` folder of this repository.

## Installation

If the user has the correct version of the OpenCL SDK installed, RAMP can simply be installed using

```
 $ python setup.py install
